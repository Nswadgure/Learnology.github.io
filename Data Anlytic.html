<!-- 		<strong>AI can be broadly classified into two:</strong><br>
		<strong>1. Narrow AI:</strong> <br>This type of AI is also referred to as “weak AI”. Narrow AI usually carries out one particular task with extremely high efficiency which mimics human intelligence. An example would be any computer game where one player is the user and the other player is the computer. What usually happens is, the machine is fed with all the rules and regulations of the game and the possible outcomes of the game manually. In turn, this machine applies these data to beat whoever is playing against it. A single particular task is carried out to mimic human intelligence.<br>
        <strong>2. Strong AI:</strong><br> Also referred to as “general AI”. Here is where there is no difference between a machine and a human being. This is the kind of AI we see in the movies, the robots. A close example (not the perfect example) would be the world’s first citizen robot, Sophia. She was introduced to the world on October 11, 2017. Sophia talks like she has emotions.<br>
       <br>
		<strong>There are 4 distinct categories of AI namely: </strong><br>
		<strong>1. Reactive machines:</strong><br>These are the most basic type of AI and are purely reactive as the name suggests. They neither can form memories nor can use past experiences to form decisions. An example would be IBM’s Deep Blue chess-playing supercomputer which is mentioned above. Deep Blue beat the international grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997. It can choose the most optimal of the chess moves and beat the opponent. Apart from a rarely used chess-specific rule against repeating the same move three times, Deep Blue ignores everything before the present moment, thus not storing any memories. This type of AI just perceives the world, the chess game in the case of Deep Blue, and acts on it<br>
		<strong>2. Limited memory:</strong>><br> These machines can look into the past. Not the ability to predict what happened in the past, but the usage of memories to form decisions. A common example could include self-driving cars. For example, they observe other cars’ speed and directions and act accordingly. This requires monitoring of how a car is driven for a specific amount of time. Just like how humans observe and learn the specifics. These pieces of information are not stored in the library of experiences of the machines, unlike humans. We humans automatically save everything in the library of our experiences and can learn from it, but limited memory machines can’t.<br>
		<strong>3. Theory of mind</strong><br> These are types of machines that can understand that people have beliefs, emotions, expectations, etc., and have some of their own. A “theory of mind” machine can think emotionally and can respond with emotions. Even though there are close examples of this kind of AI like Sophia, the research is not complete yet. In other words, these machines have a notion of not just the world, but also the existing entities of the world, like human beings, animals, etc. These machines will be capable of answering simple “what if” questions. They’ll have a sense of empathy.<br>
		<strong>4. Self-Awareness:</strong> These types of machines can be called human equivalents. Of course, no such machines exist and the invention of them would be a milestone in the field of AI. These basically will have a sense of consciousness of who they are. The sense of “I” or “me”. Here’s a basic example of the difference between “theory of mind” and “self-awareness” AI. The feeling of I want to play is different from the feeling of I know I want to play. In the latter, if you notice, there is a sense of consciousness and is a characteristic of a self-aware machine, while the former feeling is a characteristic of a theory-of-mind machine. Self-aware machines will have the ability to predict others’ feelings. Let’s hope the invention is not so far away!<br>

 <p>
    Apart from the above-mentioned capabilities, a Data Analyst should also possess skills such as Statistics, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Data Visualization. Also, if you have a knowledge of Machine Learning, then that would make you stand out from the crowd.
 </p>
 <p>
    On average, a Data Analyst can expect a salary of ₹404,660 (IND) or $83,878 (US).  As experts, data analysts are often called on to use their skills and tools to provide competitive analysis and identify trends within industries.

	<br><center><h2> <strong>What’s the difference between data analytics and data science?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		You’ll find that the terms “data science” and “data analytics” tend to be used interchangeably. However, they are two different fields and denote two distinct career paths. What’s more, they each have a very different impact on the business or organization.
	</p>
    <p>
        One key difference between data scientists and data analysts lies in what they do with the data and the outcomes they achieve. A data analyst will seek to answer specific questions or address particular challenges that have already been identified and are known to the business. To do this, they examine large datasets with the goal of identifying trends and patterns. They then “visualize” their findings in the form of charts, graphs, and dashboards. These visualizations are shared with key stakeholders and used to make informed, data-driven strategic decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
        A data scientist, on the other hand, considers what questions the business should or could be asking. They design new processes for data modeling, write algorithms, devise predictive models, and run custom analyses. For example: They might build a machine to leverage a dataset and automate certain actions based on that data—and, with continuous monitoring and testing, and as new patterns and trends emerge, improve and optimize that machine wherever possible. In short: data analysts tackle and solve discrete questions about data, often on request, revealing insights that can be acted upon by other stakeholders, while data scientists build systems to automate and optimize the overall functioning of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another main difference lies in the tools and skills required for each role. Data analysts are typically expected to be proficient in software like Excel and, in some cases, querying and programming languages like SQL, R, SAS, and Python. Analysts need to be comfortable using such tools and languages to carry out data mining, statistical analysis, database management and reporting. Data scientists, on the other hand, might be expected to be proficient in Hadoop, Java, Python, machine learning, and object-oriented programming, together with software development, data mining, and data analysis.

	<center><h2><strong> What are the different types of data analysis?</strong></h2></center>
    <center><img src="https://dpbnri2zg3lc2.cloudfront.net/en/wp-content/uploads/old-blog-uploads/the-four-main-types-of-data-analysis.jpg"></center>

    <p>
	<strong> 1) Descriptive analytics</strong>Descriptive analytics is a simple, surface-level type of analysis that looks at what has happened in the past. The two main techniques used in descriptive analytics are data aggregation and data mining—so, the data analyst first gathers the data and presents it in a summarized format (that’s the aggregation part) and then “mines” the data to discover patterns. The data is then presented in a way that can be easily understood by a wide audience (not just data experts). It’s important to note that descriptive analytics doesn’t try to explain the historical data or establish cause-and-effect relationships; at this stage, it’s simply a case of determining and describing the “what”. Descriptive analytics draws on descriptive statistics, which you can learn about here.<br>
	<strong> 2) Diagnostic analytics</strong>While descriptive analytics looks at the “what”, diagnostic analytics explores the “why”. When running diagnostic analytics, data analysts will first seek to identify anomalies within the data—that is, anything that cannot be explained by the data in front of them. For example: If the data shows that there was a sudden drop in sales for the month of March, the data analyst will need to investigate the cause. To do this, they’ll embark on what’s known as the discovery phase, identifying any additional data sources that might tell them more about why such anomalies arose. Finally, the data analyst will try to uncover causal relationships—for example, looking at any events that may correlate or correspond with the decrease in sales. At this stage, data analysts may use probability theory, regression analysis, filtering, and time-series data analytics.<br>
    <strong> 3) Predictive analytics</strong>Just as the name suggests, predictive analytics tries to predict what is likely to happen in the future. This is where data analysts start to come up with actionable, data-driven insights that the company can use to inform their next steps. Predictive analytics estimates the likelihood of a future outcome based on historical data and probability theory, and while it can never be completely accurate, it does eliminate much of the guesswork from key business decisions. Predictive analytics can be used to forecast all sorts of outcomes—from what products will be most popular at a certain time, to how much the company revenue is likely to increase or decrease in a given period. Ultimately, predictive analytics is used to increase the business’s chances of “hitting the mark” and taking the most appropriate action.<br>
    <strong> 4) Prescriptive analytics</strong>Building on predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics advises on the actions and decisions that should be taken. In other words, prescriptive analytics shows you how you can take advantage of the outcomes that have been predicted. When conducting prescriptive analysis, data analysts will consider a range of possible scenarios and assess the different actions the company might take. Prescriptive analytics is one of the more complex types of analysis, and may involve working with algorithms, machine learning, and computational modeling procedures. However, the effective use of prescriptive analytics can have a huge impact on the company’s decision-making process and, ultimately, on the bottom line.<br>

   <p>
    Now we’ve set the scene in terms of the overall data analyst role, let’s drill down to the actual process of data analysis. Here, we’ll outline the five main steps that a data analyst will follow when tackling a new project:   <br>

    <center><h1>What does the future hold for data analytics?
    </h1></center>
    <p>
        Data has become one of the most abundant—and valuable—commodities in today’s market; you’ll often hear about big data and how important it is. However, while it’s often claimed that data is the new oil, it’s important to recognize that data is only valuable when it’s refined. The value of the data that a company has depends on what they do with it—and that’s why the role of the data analyst is becoming increasingly pivotal. Still, the sheer value of data (and data analytics) is reflected in the way the market has surged in recent years: in 2019, the global data analytics market was valued at $49 billion USD—that’s more than double what it was worth in 2015. And, from 2020 to 2023, the market is expected to grow at a rate of 30% per year, taking it up to $77.6 billion USD.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what does this mean in terms of career prospects? At the time of writing, a search for data analyst jobs on indeed.com turns up 20,000 vacancies in the United States alone. And we can expect this figure to rise: according to a report published by the World Economic Forum, data analysts will be one of the most in-demand professionals in 2020 and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re considering a career in data analytics, there has never been a better time. As the market grows and businesses face a significant skills shortage, data analysts will increasingly benefit from high demand, a rich variety of opportunities, and competitive compensation.
