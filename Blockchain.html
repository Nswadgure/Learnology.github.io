	<center><h2><strong>◆Blockchain Technology◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p><strong>What is Blockchain Technology?</strong><br>Imagine a world where you can send money directly to someone without a bank – in seconds instead of days, and you don’t pay exorbitant bank fees.

		Or one where you store money in an online wallet not tied to a bank, meaning you are your own bank and have complete control over your money. You don’t need a bank’s permission to access or move it, and never have to worry about a third party taking it away, or a government’s economic policy manipulating it.
		
		This is not a world of the future; it is a world that an avid but growing number of early adopters live in right now. And these are just a few of the important blockchain technology use cases that are transforming the way we trust and exchange value. We’ll get into the rest later on.
		
		Yet, for many, blockchain technology is still a mysterious or even intimidating topic. Some even remain skeptical that we’ll use this technology in the future. This skepticism that exists today is understandable because we’re still very early in the development and widespread adoption of blockchain technology.
		
		2021 is to blockchain what the late 1990s were to the internet. And like the internet, blockchain technology is anything but a fad, it’s here to stay, and if you’re reading this, you’re early too.
		
		</p>
	<center><h2><strong>◆Blockchain For Beginners◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>Blockchain technology is the concept or protocol behind the running of the blockchain. Blockchain technology makes cryptocurrencies (digital currencies secured by cryptography) like Bitcoin work just like the internet makes email possible.The blockchain is an immutable (unchangeable, meaning a transaction or file recorded cannot be changed) distributed digital ledger (digital record of transactions or data stored in multiple places on a computer network) with many use cases beyond cryptocurrencies.
	<p>Immutable and distributed are two fundamental blockchain properties. The immutability of the ledger means you can always trust it to be accurate. Being distributed protects the blockchain from network attacks.Each transaction or record on the ledger is stored in a “block.” For example, blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain consist of an average of more than 500 Bitcoin transactions.
       The information contained in a block is dependent on and linked to the information in a previous block and, over time, forms a chain of transactions. Hence the word blockchain.
	</p>
	<center><img src="https://workshub.imgix.net/d873263eb59c815c282cf3eb5a3b13e3?fit=crop&crop=entropy&auto=format"></center><br>
	<center><h2><strong>◆Blockchain: In Most Simple Words◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		Blockchain is a peer-to-peer decentralized distributed ledger technology that makes the records of any digital asset transparent and unchangeable and works without involving any third-party intermediary. It is an emerging and revolutionary technology that is attracting a lot of public attention due to its capability to reduce risks and frauds in a scalable manner.  Now here comes the question why is Blockchain a distributed, decentralized P2P network? A decentralized network offers multiple benefits over the traditional centralized network, including increased system reliability and privacy. Moreover, such networks are much easier to scale and deal with no real single point of failure. The reason why Blockchain is distributed is because of shared communication and distributed processing. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The P2P architecture of Blockchains provides several benefits such as greater security compared to traditional client-server based networks. A distributed P2P network, paired with a majority consensus requirement, provides Blockchains a relatively high degree of resistance to malicious activities. 
	</p>
	<center><h2><strong>◆Bitcoin and Blockchain: How They are Related?◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		Although the advent of Blockchain has taken the world by storm, many people still get confused about these two terms. Thus, it is important to understand how these terms differ and how they are interrelated. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is an application of Blockchain, whereas Blockchain is simply an underlying technology behind Bitcoin that is implemented through various channels. So if you are working on Blockchain and learning Blockchain, then you are not actually learning cryptocurrency but learning how cryptocurrency works.

    <center><h2><strong>◆Working Mechanism of Blockchain◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
        Blockchain can be defined as a shared ledger, allowing thousands of connected computers or servers to maintain a single, secured, and immutable ledger. Blockchain can perform user transactions without involving any third-party intermediaries. In order to perform transactions, all one needs is to have its wallet. A Blockchain wallet is nothing but a program that allows one to spend cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, etc. Such wallets are secured by cryptographic methods(public and private keys) so that one can manage and have full control over his transactions.
		There are now wallet options that allow you to add an address and generate a unique domain name, such as. sol. Digital eyes (best solana nft marketplace) has introduced a Bonafide that provides such services. Now, this is how Blockchain works. Initially, when a user creates a transaction over a Blockchain network, a block will be created, representing that transaction is created. Once a block is created, the requested transaction is broadcasted over the peer-to-peer network, consisting of computers, known as nodes, which then validate the transaction. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A verified transaction can involve cryptocurrency, contracts, records, or any other valuable information. Once a transaction is verified, it is combined with other blocks to create a new block of data for the ledger.   Here it is important to note that with each new transaction, a secured block is created, which are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles. Whenever a new block is created, it is added to the existing Blockchain network confirming that it is secured and immutable.
	</p>
    <center><h2><strong>◆Benefits of using Blockchain Technology◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		<strong>1.Immutability</strong><br>
		In a traditional database, you have to trust a system administrator that he is not going to change the data. But with Blockchain, there is no possibility of changing the data or altering the data; the data present inside the Blockchain is permanent; one cannot delete or undo it.<br>
		<strong>2.Transparency</strong><br>
		Centralized systems are not transparent, whereas Blockchain (a decentralized system) offers complete transparency. By utilizing blockchain technology, organizations and enterprises can go for a complete decentralized network where there is no need for any centralized authority, thus improving the transparency of the entire system.<br>
		<strong>3.High Availability </strong><br>
		Unlike centralized systems, Blockchain is a decentralized system of P2P network which is highly available due to its decentralized nature. Since in the Blockchain network, everyone is on a P2P network, and everyone has a computer running, therefore, even if one peer goes down, the other peers still work.<br>
		<strong>4.High Security </strong><br>
		This is another major benefit that Blockchain offers. Technology is assumed to offer high security as all the transactions of Blockchain are cryptographically secure and provide integrity. Thus instead of relying on third-party, you need to put your trust in cryptographic algorithms.<br>
	</p>
	<center><h2><strong>◆History of Blockchain◆</strong></h2></center>
    <p>
		Blockchain isn’t just a database, it’s a new technology stack with ‘digital trust’ that is revolutionizing the way we exchange value and information across the internet, by taking out the ‘gatekeepers’ from the process. For a complete and more detailed deep dive check out our article: A Concise History of Blockchain Technology.<br>
		<strong>➣Who Invented Blockchain?</strong><br>
		•The first blockchain-like protocol was proposed by cryptographer David Chaum in 1982. Later in 1991, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta wrote about their work on Consortiums.<br>
        •But it was Satoshi Nakamoto (presumed pseudonym for a person or group of people) who invented and implemented the first blockchain network after deploying the world’s first digital currency, Bitcoin.<br>
        •Cryptography is a deep and fascinating discipline with a history that goes back further than blockchain. For a richer understanding of  how cryptography helps blockchain technology, check out: Why Cryptography Makes Blockchain Unstoppable.<br>
        <strong>➣Who Owns Blockchain Technology?</strong><br>
		•Because blockchain technology is the technology behind the blockchain, it cannot be owned. It’s like the internet. But anyone can use the technology to run and own their own blockchains.<br>
        <strong>Who Founded Bitcoin?</strong><br>
		•Satoshi Nakamoto.
    </p>
    <center><h2><strong>◆Types of Blockchains◆</strong></h2></center> 
	<p>
		There are four types of blockchains:<br>
		<strong>1. Public Blockchains</strong><br>
		•Public blockchains are open, decentralized networks of computers accessible to anyone wanting to request or validate a transaction (check for accuracy). Those (miners) who validate transactions receive rewards.<br>
        •Public blockchains use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms (discussed later). Two common examples of public blockchains include the Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains.<br>
        <strong>2. Private Blockchains</strong><br>
		•Private blockchains are not open, they have access restrictions. People who want to join require permission from the system administrator. They are typically governed by one entity, meaning they’re centralized. For example, Hyperledger is a private, permissioned blockchain.<br>
        <strong>3. Hybrid Blockchains or Consortiums</strong><br>
		•Consortiums are a combination of public and private blockchains and contain centralized and decentralized features. For example, Energy Web Foundation, Dragonchain, and R3.<br>
        <strong>4. Sidechains</strong><br>
		•A sidechain is a blockchain running parallel to the main chain. It allows users to move digital assets between two different blockchains and improves scalability and efficiency. An example of a sidechain is the Liquid Network.<br>        
	</p>
	<center><h2><strong>◆What Is the Difference Between Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains?◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		➣Bitcoin and Etherum are the two biggest cryptocurrencies and blockchains, so discussing and comparing them makes sense.<br>
		<strong>1.Bitcoin Basics</strong><br>
		•The Bitcoin network is a public, decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that allows users to send and receive bitcoins without a bank getting involved. The digital currency or bitcoin token uses the ticker symbol BTC, and is the only cryptocurrency traded on the Bitcoin network.<br>
        •Transactions are recorded using a digital ledger, and nodes ensure the PoW consensus mechanism is followed (or that mining happens). For many, Bitcoin seems complicated, but it isn’t when you view it as a combination of three things:<br>
		<strong>A.)A peer-to-peer payment system:</strong><br>
		You can send money (BTC) from one person or company to another without the need for a bank. Sending money this way is faster, more secure, and cheaper than using traditional methods.<br>
        <strong>B.)A decentralized system like the internet</strong>,so it’s not controlled by one entity and cannot be stopped by a third party.<br>
        <strong>C.)A store of value like gold (often called digital gold)</strong>, but much easier to transfer than gold.

	<p>
		<strong>2.Ethereum Basics</strong><br>
		•In 2013, after traveling, meeting with bitcoin developers, and discovering Bitcoin’s limitations, Vitlaik Buterin decided to improve upon the Bitcoin blockchain and built Ethereum.<br>
        •The Ethereum network is a public, decentralized peer-to-peer network. Like Bitcoin, it uses nodes and allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency—in this case, Ether.<br>
		•The network is much more than a payment system—it was primarily created to deploy decentralized applications (dapps) and smart contracts.<br>
		•Dapps are simply ‘decentralized apps,’ or computer programs that interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts, however, operate on the Ethereum blockchain, and are contracts that automatically execute without an intermediary once certain conditions (written into computer code) are met. For example, a smart contract could be programmed to send a designated person a portion of your Bitcoin when you die.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>3.Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Blockchains</strong><br>
		•In summary, Bitcoin and Ethereum networks are public, decentralized peer-to-peer networks with their own tokens: bitcoins and Ether. Both rely on cryptography, and both use digital ledger technology. For a complete Ethereum vs. Bitcoin match up check out our deep dive post: Ethereum Vs Bitcoin: What’s the Difference?<br> 
        •But they differ significantly in purpose and capability. Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system and a store of value. Its blockchain is a database of all bitcoin transactions and tracks their ownership. Ethereum is more than a payment system and allows smart contracts and apps to be built on it, making it a more sophisticated blockchain.<br>

<center><h2><strong>How to Invest in Blockchain Technology?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		With blockchain offering some promising use cases, helping many companies become more efficient, and attracting big companies like Amazon and Tesla, it can be an attractive investment.
        But there are risks: It’s a new technology, and many projects will not pan out. So, invest only what you can afford to lose, do your own research to determine if the project (or initial coin offering) is worth investing in, and decide what level of exposure you want.<br>
		For example, you can get more exposure by investing in cryptocurrencies directly instead of an exchange-traded fund (ETF).
        That being said, here are a variety of ways you can invest in the blockchain depending on your goals and risk tolerance:
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>1.Buy shares in companies using blockchain</strong> (e.g., Visa, Walmart, and Siemens) on traditional stock exchanges like the NYSE. You can buy shares by using an online broker such as Vanguard and Betterment (U.S.).<br>
		<strong>2.Invest in companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet</strong>, e.g., Square, WeWork, MicroStrategy, and Tesla. Again, use an online broker to buy shares.<br>
		<strong>3.Buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum</strong>directly on Centralized Finance (CeFi) or Decentralized (DeFi) exchanges. Centralized exchanges were the norm in the crypto world until decentralized exchanges arrived. With centralized exchanges, you don’t have your own private keys, and the exchange is the custodian for storing your funds. Decentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer, and there’s no intermediary. Examples of CeFi exchanges include Binance, Kraken, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Luno, and Coinbase. Examples of DeFi exchanges include Uniswap, Compound, KyberSwap, Airswap, IDEX, SushiSwap, Balancer, and Totle.<br>
		<strong>4.Invest in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs).</strong> ETFs are a basket of securities that track an asset or index you can buy or sell on an exchange throughout the day. For example, many traditional ETFs will include bonds, currencies, commodities, and stocks and track the S&P 500 Index. In the crypto space, you get a variety of ETFs you can invest in, such as a Bitcoin ETF that tracks the price of Bitcoin. Each ETF will differ depending on who issues it. Companies that offer ETFs include Grayscale, Galaxy Digital, and Gemini.<br>
        <strong>5.Invest in crypto mining companies such as</strong> Riot, Hive, and Marathon. Many mining companies let investors participate indirectly by offering equity in their companies. To invest in Riot, use an American-based online broker like Robinhood. To invest in Hive and Marathon, use a Canadian-based broker like Questrade, TD Direct Investing, or BMO InvestorLine.<br>
		<strong>6.Buy crypto hardware and mine cryptocurrency yourself</strong> While Bitcoin mining requires a large capital outlay, there are other tokens you can mine for a reasonably low barrier to entry. For example, Helium miners cost roughly $500 and mint HNT using the ‘proof of coverage’ consensus protocol to verify new blocks. Get started with cryptocurrency mining by reading our short guide on Bitcoin mining.<br>
		<strong>7.Invest in mining pools</strong> An alternative to mining cryptocurrency yourself is to join a mining pool. Mining pools pool together the computational power of others on the network to improve the chances of mining a block. The rewards for all blocks mined are shared among miners in the pool. Slush Pool is a popular mining pool.
	</p> 
	<center><h2><strong>◆Traditional Finance and Blockchain Investment Strategies◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		•In some ways, the process of investing in shares and cryptocurrencies is the same. First, you can buy cryptocurrencies on exchanges like you can buy shares through an online broker.
		Second, you are also able to apply traditional investment principles to investing in cryptocurrencies and the blockchain. For example, you can invest the same amount of money into Bitcoin each month regardless of price (dollar-cost averaging) to remove any emotion out of the investment process.<br>
		•But there are also investment strategies that are unique to the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, like yield farming.
		Read on to learn about ten common traditional finance and blockchain investment strategies you can use when investing in public blockchain companies and cryptocurrencies.

	<center><h2><strong>◆What is the Future Scope of Blockchain Technology in India ?◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
		<strong>1. Blockchain in Digital Advertising:</strong><br>
		Presently, digital advertising faces a lot of challenges like domain fraud, bot traffic, lack of transparency and long payment models, due to the issue like incentives are not affiliated. Because of this the promoters and publishers feel they are dropping the deal. Blockchain has provided a solution to carry transparency to the supply chain as it fetches trust in a trustless environment. Blockchain allows right companies to succeed, by decreasing the number of bad players in the supply chain. Publishers can also gather a vast percentage of the total advertisement dollars arriving the ecosystem. The Blockchain technology is still in its beginning; however, this technology should stay here, and all advertisement companies are observing that how blockchain will help to enhance their business.<br>
		<strong>2. Blockchain in Cyber Security:</strong><br>
		Though the blockchain is a public ledger, the data is verified and encrypted using innovative cryptography technology. In this manner, the information or data is less likely to be attacked or altered without authorization.<br>
		<strong>3. Blockchain will remove the requirement of the third party:</strong><br>
		With the help of Blockchain technology, basically, it is possible to impact a varied range of processes and techniques. It eliminates the need of trusted third party in the transactions. Well most prominent organizations in the world exist today to function as a trusted third party, for instance, SWIFT, and the Depository Trust Cleaning Company.Corporate chances flourish for companies that can build applied Blockchain technologies aiming for particular transactions, like the mortgage industry. The existing mortgages needed a complicated web of title searches, title insurance, and uncountable minor transaction fees which are required to keep the system running. These systems occur because traditionally, the transfer of land has been a process which requires a significant amount of belief in the old records. The Blockchain technology was going to address all these concerns, and a particular propertyâ€™s ledger consists of a verifiable and validated transactions history, lowering the necessity of institutions to provide risk modification and trust services.<br>
		<strong>4. Governments will provide their digital currencies:</strong><br>
		It is confirmed that the paper money at its last phase, but it is also found that the authorized currency is facing a severe competition by cryptocurrencies. In 2017, it is observed that the price of Bitcoin has flown which was never seen by any single service or money all around the world. The currency is still one of the most appreciated properties available in the market, and the nation took notice, due to the price of Bitcoin is denied by the basic idea of demand and supply. The need for Bitcoin will again climb at some point, with a fixed limit of twenty-one million units of Bitcoin. Because of this, a few governments will get a chance to create their digital currencies to avoid dropping face to an independent and unregulated property and participate in an open market.<br>
		<strong>5. Blockchain beyond the world of computing:</strong><br>
		In 2017, the world had seen the infinite collection of options in the use of blockchain technology. Currently, most of the countries are developing their blockchain strategies to hold the future. Also, it is highly possible that the rest of the advanced European countries will follow suit by accepting the blockchain technology to create a constant financial environment that helps nations on ruins like Greece and Spain. There are specific problems associated with the security of finances, and Blockchain will be used to address these kinds of issues. Blockchain will also be used to generate registries which are used for medical purposes, to manage insurance policies, and to interrupt the model of useless data storage.<br>
		<strong>6. Managing World trade with the help of Blockchain Technology:</strong><br>
		Blockchain is valuable to business particularly how it makes easy for anybody to track the supply chain of everything provided using the technology. It will be outdated to track the numbers, and no company wants to lose a shipment because of human inability. Well, it is easy to register a cargo shipments in the Blockchain, this enables the parties involved in the job operation to follow the delivery procedure from point A to B. With the help of Blockchain technology, it is easy for the custom agents to track down the forbidden products like fake medicines, changed food products, false clothes reproduction, fake auto parts, electronic apparatus and other piracy agents which are trying to provide the low-quality goods inside any country without talking about the internal laws.<br>
		<strong>>7. Supply chain Management:</strong><br>
		With the help of blockchain technology, it is possible to document the transaction in an everlasting distributed record, and supervise the transactions more sturdily and transparently. This also helps to minimize human errors and time delays. It is also used monitor costs, employment, and releases at each point of the supply chain. But this has severe effect for understanding and monitoring the actual ecological impacts of products. Not only this the decentralized ledger can also be utilized to check the legitimacy or fair trade status of products by following them form their source.<br>
		<strong>8. The Blockchain in Forecasting:</strong><br>
		The blockchain technology is set to alter the complete methodology for research, consulting, analysis and forecasting. The global distributed prediction markets are created with the help of online platforms.<br>
		<strong>9. Use of Blockchain in the Internet of Things and Networking:</strong><br>
		Different companies like Samsung and IBM are utilizing the blockchain technology for a new concept called ADEPT, this will help to create a distributed network of IoT devices. The blockchain technology will remove the requirement for a central location to manage the communication between them; this will function as a public ledger for a massive number of devices.

	<center><h2><strong>◆Overview of 10 Major Investment Strategies◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>
	    <strong>1.Growth Investing:</strong><br>
		Investors look for companies that demonstrate above-average growth. Investors using this strategy will often still invest in shares even if they seem expensive.To narrow down your search, focus on industries currently doing well or have historically performed. With the blockchain technology market expected to grow in size, there are bound to be several companies with strong growth potential.<br>
		<strong>2.Value Investing:</strong><br>
		Investors look for undervalued companies, e.g., their price doesn’t fully reflect their value. Successful value investing often requires that you hold your shares for the long term.<br>
		<strong>3.Dividend Growth Investing:</strong><br>
		Investors invest in companies that have a history of paying out dividends. You can look at a company’s financial statements to see if they pay out dividends. Look for a yield of between 2-6%.<br>
		<strong>4.Indexing:</strong><br>
		This is more of a cautious and passive investment strategy, but indexed investors often outperform more active investors. These investors typically invest in an index fund.An index fund consists of pooled funds from investors, is managed by a fund manager, and automatically invests in the companies of a specific index like the S&P 500 to effectively track against the index’s performance.It is different from an ETF in that you can only buy or sell index funds at the end of the day and not throughout. An example of a cryptocurrency index fund is the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW).<br>
		<strong>5.Day Trading:</strong><br>
		Day trading is a more active and aggressive short-term trading strategy. Investors frequently trade throughout the day to capitalize on small market movements to make a profit. Day traders will use technical analysis to develop trade ideas around how the market will move. Day trading cryptocurrency is equally lucrative and risky due to highly volatile assets.<br>
		<strong>6.Algorithmic Trading:</strong><br>
		Also known as automatic trading, this investment strategy involves using computer programs to execute trades based on pre-programmed instructions such as price, time, etc. A large portion of the American market consists of algorithmic trading. AlgoTrader is an automated trading program you can use for Bitcoin trading.<br>
		<strong>7.Contrarian Investing:</strong><br>
		Contrarian investors purposely go against the market sentiment. They buy when people are selling and sell when people are buying.By following the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index, you can get a good idea of the prevailing sentiment in the Bitcoin market and then do the opposite: buy when people are fearful and sell when they’re greedy.<br>
		<strong>8.Arbitrage:</strong><br>
		This strategy involves taking advantage of price differences of the same asset between markets. You buy the asset in one market and then sell it for a higher price in another.Because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often differ in price between countries, there are great opportunities to profit from this strategy.In a nutshell, traders will buy cryptocurrency on an overseas exchange (for a lower price) and then transfer it to a local exchange and sell it for a higher price.As Business Tech reports, you can make 2-4% per trade using the right investment platform. Just make sure you follow local exchange control laws because there are usually limits to how much local currency you can move beyond the borders.<br>
		<strong>9.Yield Farming:</strong><br>
		This blockchain-specific investment strategy involves lending your cryptocurrency to someone else via smart contracts.The lendee pays you a fee for your services. Yield farmers often move their cryptocurrency between different lending platforms to maximize returns. A few yield farming platforms include Compound Finance, Aave, and MarketDAO. Learn more about DeFi yield farming.<br>
		<strong>10.Diversification:</strong><br>
		Spread your risk and invest in different assets and companies to limit your overall downside while exposing you to more opportunities to make money. Diversification is more than just an investment strategy; it’s a smart way to invest that most financial experts and brokers encourage.This strategy works well for traditional finance and cryptocurrency.In traditional markets, you can spread risk across bonds, money markets, and shares— and even diversify your share portfolio by investing across industries.For cryptocurrencies and blockchain, you can invest in different public blockchain companies and also cryptocurrencies with different use cases like Bitcoin (payments), Ethereum (smart contracts), Monero (privacy), and XRP (cross border payments).If you really want to prioritize diversification, you should invest across traditional and crypto markets, and rebalance your portfolio as needed.<br>
