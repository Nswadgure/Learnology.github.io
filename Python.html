	<p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.</p><br>

	<center><h2><strong>why learn python?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>Ever since Python was released in 1991 as a high-level interpreted programming language, it has been a forever-favorite for many coders due to its vast library and easy syntax. Here is a chart presenting how python has grown over the past few years amidst other popular coding languages.
		Normally, when problems involve concepts like linear algebra, ordinary or partial differential equations etc., it would take a long time to solve the problems analytically. In terms of engineering, there are usually boundary conditions present which increases the difficulty level by twofold measure.
		In addition to being a programming language, Python is also a popular scripting language. Even in core industries, python is used in areas like manufacturing and production for optimization. Even if the code is written in another language, it is rewritten in python scripts before feeding it to the computers. This is because python is the most popular scripting language in use and is the interface between industries and codes.  Once the computer reads the scripts and interprets it correctly, it is checked for errors. The code can then be reused when needed.<br>

Simple and easy to use:

Consider the following examples. They are basically the same problem coded in C++ and python.



From the example, it is understandable why python is preferred. It is extremely simple to use and understand. Apart from this, python is an interpreted language and it is high level.

		<center><h2><strong>Statement, Indentation and Comment in Python
			</strong></h2> </center>
	<p> 
		Instructions written in the source code for execution are called statements. There are different types of statements in the Python programming language like Assignment statements, Conditional statements, Looping statements, etc. These all help the user to get the required output. For example, n = 50 is an assignment statement.<br>
		Multi-Line Statements: Statements in Python can be extended to one or more lines using parentheses (), braces {}, square brackets [], semi-colon (;), continuation character slash (\). When the programmer needs to do long calculations and cannot fit his statements into one line, one can make use of these characters. 

		<center><h2><strong>Python Language advantages and applications
		</strong></h2> </center><br>
		<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. It has fewer steps when compared to Java and C. It was founded in 1991 by developer Guido Van Rossum. Python ranks among the most popular and fastest-growing languages in the world. Python is a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use language. In addition, the community is very active there. It is used in many organizations as it supports multiple programming paradigms. It also performs automatic memory management.
		</p><br>
		<p><strong>Advantages : 
		</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>1.Presence of third-party modules </li>
			<li>2.Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics etc) </li>
			<li>3.Open source and community development </li>
			<li>4.Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write</li>
			<li>5.User-friendly data structures</li>
			<li>6.High-level language </li>
			<li>7.Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type) </li>
			<li>8.Object-oriented language </li>
			<li>9.Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding</li>
			<li>10.Portable and Interactive</li><br>

		</ul>
		<p><strong>Applications: 
		</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>1.GUI based desktop applications</li>

<center><h2><strong>Where Python Programming all began</strong></h2></center>
<p>
	Python is also one of the older web development languages out there, made by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands in the early 90s. The language borrows heavily from C, C++, SmallTalk, Unix Shell, Modula-3, ABC, Algol-68 and other scripting languages. Rossum continues to direct the language progress, although a core development team at the institute now maintains most of it.
</p><br>


<center><h2><strong>Learning Python Programming Language</strong></h2></center>
<p>
	<p><strong>properties 
	</strong><br>
	Python is implicitly and dynamically typed, so you do not have to declare variables. The types are enforced, and the variables are also case sensitive, so var and VAR are treated as two separate variables. If you want to know how any object work, you just need to type the following:<br>
	<strong>Data types:
	</strong><br>
	Let’s move ahead to data types. The data structures in Python are dictionaries, tuples and lists. Sets can be found in the sets library that is available in all versions of Python from 2.5 onwards. Lists are similar to one-dimensional arrays, although you can also have lists of other lists. Dictionaries are essentially associative arrays or hash tables. Tuples are one-dimensional arrays. Now, Python arrays can be of any type, and the types are always zero.<br>
	<strong>Strings
	</strong><br>
	Python strings can either use single or double quotation marks, and you can use quotation marks of one kind in a string using another kind, so the following is valid:

	“This is a ‘valid’ string.”
	
	Multi-strings are enclosed in single or triple double-quotes. Python can support Unicode right from the start, using the following syntax:
	
	u”This is Unicode.”<br>
</p><br>

<center><h2>What is Scope in Python?</h2></center>
<p>
	Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program. However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them where you could use their objects without any prefix. A few examples of scope created during code execution in Python are as follows:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>1.A local scope refers to the local objects available in the current function.</li>
		<li>A module-level scope refers to the global objects of the current module accessible in the program.</li>
		<li>A global scope refers to the objects available throughout the code execution since their inception.</li>
		<li>An outermost scope refers to all the built-in names callable in the program. The objects in this scope are searched last to find the name referenced.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<center><h2>What are the common built-in data types in Python?</h2></center>
<p>There are several built-in data types in Python. Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides type() and isinstance() functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories-<br>
</p>
<center><h2>Python OOPs Concepts</h2></center>
<p>In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.</p>

<p><strong>Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>1.Class</li>
		<li>2. Object</li>
		<li>3. Polymorphism</li>
		<li>Encapsulation</li>
		<li>Inheritance</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20200623174126/Python-OOPS-Concept.png" alt=""></center>
<p><strong>Class </strong>
	A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods<br>
	To understand the need for creating a class let’s consider an example, let’s say you wanted to track the number of dogs that may have different attributes like breed, age. If a list is used, the first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element could represent its age. Let’s suppose there are 100 different dogs, then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs? This lacks organization and it’s the exact need for classes. 
</p>
<p><strong>Object </strong>The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any single integer or any single string is an object. The number 12 is an object, the string “Hello, world” is an object, a list is an object that can hold other objects, and so on. You’ve been using objects all along and may not even realize it.<br>
	<ul>
		<li>State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.</li>
		<li>Behavior:It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects. </li>
		<li>Identity:  It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>
	</ul>

</p>
<center><h2><strong>Inheritance in Python</strong></h2></center>
<p>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of inheritance are: <br>
<ul>
	<li>1. It represents real-world relationships well.</li>
	<li>2. It provides reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.</li>
	<li>3. It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<center><h2>Types of Inheritance in Python</h2></center>
<p>Types of Inheritance depends upon the number of child and parent classes involved. There are four types of inheritance in Python:<br>

	<strong>1. Single Inheritance:</strong>Single inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from a single parent class, thus enabling code reusability and the addition of new features to existing code.<br>
	<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200108135809/inheritance11.png" alt=""></center><br>
	<p><strong>2. Multiple Inheritance:</strong>When a class can be derived from more than one base class this type of inheritance is called multiple inheritance. In multiple inheritance, all the features of the base classes are inherited into the derived class. <br>
	<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200108144424/multiple-inheritance1.png" alt=""></center></p>
	<p><strong>3. Multilevel Inheritance </strong>In multilevel inheritance, features of the base class and the derived class are further inherited into the new derived class. This is similar to a relationship representing a child and grandfather. 
	<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200108144705/Multilevel-inheritance1.png" alt=""></center></p>
