	<p>C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.</p>

	<center><h2><strong>What is C++?</strong></h2></center>
	<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language.<br>
       <center> <img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20190430122723/cpp-program-compilation3-1024x375.png" alt=""> </center><br>
      <p> C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. <br>
        <p><strong>Some of the features & key-points to note about the programming language are as follows:
        </strong> </center></p><br>
        <ul>
            <li>1. It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has a rich library support and a variety of data-types.</li>
            <li>2. A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.</li>
            <li>3.  It is a mid-level language as we can do both systems-programming (drivers, kernels, networking etc.) and build large-scale user applications (Media Players, Photoshop, Game Engines etc.)</li>
            <li>4. Has a rich library support (Both standard ~ built-in data structures, algorithms etc.) as well 3rd party libraries (e.g. Boost libraries) for fast and rapid development.</li>
            <li>5.  C++ programs excel in execution speed. Since, it is a compiled language, and also hugely procedural. Newer languages have extra in-built default features such as garbage-collection, dynamic typing etc. which slow the execution of the program overall. Since there is no additional processing overhead like this in C++, it is blazing fast.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <center><h2><strong>C++ Programming Basics</strong></h2></center><br>
        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc.<br>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Basic Syntax and First Program in C++:</strong>   Learning C++ programming can be simplified into writing your program in a text editor and saving it with correct extension(.CPP, .C, .CP) and compiling your program using a compiler or online IDE. The “Hello World” program is the first step towards learning any programming language and also one of the simplest programs you will learn.</li>
                <li><strong>2.  Basic I/O in C++:</strong> C++ comes with libraries which provides us with many ways for performing input and output. In C++ input and output is performed in the form of a sequence of bytes or more commonly known as streams. </li>
				<li><strong>3.  Comments in C++:</strong> A well-documented program is a good practice as a programmer. It makes a program more readable and error finding become easier. One important part of good documentation is Comments. In computer programming, a comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program</li>
				<li><strong>4.  Data Types and Modifiers in C++:</strong> All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored. Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store. </li>
				<li><strong>5.  Variables and Types in C++: </strong>   A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location. In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.</li>
            </ul>
         </p>



	
		<center><h2><strong>Features of C++</strong></h2> </center><br>

		<center><img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/features-of-c.png" alt=""></center><br>

<p><ul>
	<li><strong>1. Machine Independent:</strong> A C++ executable is not platform-independent (compiled programs on Linux won’t run on Windows), however they are machine independent.

		Let us understand this feature of C++ with the help of an example. Suppose you have written a piece of code which can run on Linux/Windows/Mac OSx which makes C++ Machine Independent but the executable file of the C++ cannot run on different operating systems.</li>
		<li><strong>2.Simple: </strong>  It is a simple language in the sense that programs can be broken down into logical units and parts, has rich library support, and a variety of data-types. Also, the Auto Keyword of the C++ makes life easier.</li>
		<li><strong>3.High-Level Language</strong>C++ is a High-Level Language, unlike C which is a Mid-Level Programming Language. It makes life easier to work in C++ as it is a high-level language as it is closely associated with the human-comprehensible English language.</li>
        <li><strong>4.Case-sensitive:</strong>It is clear that the C++ is a case-sensitive programming language. For example, cin is used to take input from the input stream. But if the “Cin” won’t work. Other languages like HTML and MySQL are not case-sensitive language.</li>
		<li><strong>5.Compiler Based:</strong>C++ is a compiler-based language, unlike Python. That is C++ programs used to be compiled and their executable file is used to run it. Due to which C++ is a relatively faster language than Java and Python.</li>

</ul></p>

<p><strong>class:</strong>  The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class. It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.<br>
	For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc. So here, Car is the class and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their properties.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>object:</strong>An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behaviour. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.<br>
	Object take up space in memory and have an associated address like a record in pascal or structure or union in C.When a program is executed the objects interact by sending messages to one another.

	Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without having to know details of each other’s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message accepted and type of response returned by the objects.

</p>
<p><strong>Encapsulation:</strong>In normal terms, Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In Object-Oriented Programming, Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.<br>
	Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. 
</p>
<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Encapsulation-in-C-1.jpg" alt=""></center>
<p><strong>Abstraction: </strong>
	Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.<br>
	Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know about how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of accelerator, brakes etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphism: </strong>The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form.<br>
	Example: Suppose we have to write a function to add some integers, some times there are 2 integers, some times there are 3 integers. We can write the Addition Method with the same name having different parameters, the concerned method will be called according to parameters.

</p>
<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20190501131135/polymorphism_example.png" alt=""></center>
<p><strong>Inheritance:</strong>The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.<br>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>1. Sub Class:</strong>The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.</li>
		<li><strong>2. Super Class:</strong>The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base Class or Super class.</li>
		<li><strong>3. Reusability: </strong> Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class.</li>


	</ul>
