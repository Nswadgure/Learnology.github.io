		<button="lets go"><a href="https://youtu.be/lsf060bLH_Y"></a></button>
	
	<p>For the last 40-45 years, C is one of the most popular and highly recognized programming languages in the world. In fact, it is the first programming language of a huge number of individuals (including me!). Indeed, it is strongly recommended to start your programming journey with C language as it helps to understand a lot of underlying processes on the ground level, which enhances your fundamental knowledge & boosts your confidence, which further makes it easier for you to learn other high-level programming languages as well. </p>

	<center><h2><strong>What is C</strong></h2></center>
	<p>C is an imperative procedural language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code</p>

	   <p><strong>1 Procedural Language:</strong>In a procedural language like C step by step predefined instructions are carried out. C program may contain more than one function to perform a particular task. New people to programming will think that this is the only way a particular programming language works. There are other programming paradigms as well in the programming world. Most of the commonly used paradigm is an object-oriented programming language. 
	   </p>
	   <p><strong>2.Fast and Efficient:</strong>Newer languages like java, python offer more features than c programming language but due to additional processing in these languages, their performance rate gets down effectively. C programming language as the been middle-level language provides programmers access to direct manipulation with the computer hardware but higher-level languages do not allow this. That’s one of the reasons C language is considered the first choice to start learning programming languages. It’s fast because statically typed languages are faster than dynamically typed languages. </p>
	   <p><strong>3. Modularity: </strong>The concept of storing C programming language code in the form of libraries for further future uses is known as modularity. This programming language van does very little on its own most of its power is held by its libraries. C language has its own library to solve common problems like in this we can use a particular function by using a header file stored in its library. </p>
	   <p><strong>4. Statically Type: </strong>C programming language is a statically typed language. Meaning the type of variable is checked at the time of compilation but not at run time. This means each time a programmer type a program they have to mention the type of variables used. 
	   </p>
	   <p><strong>5. General Purpose Language:</strong> From system programming to photo editing software, the C programming language is used in various applications. </p>
       
<center><h2><strong> Benefits of C language over other programming languages</strong></h2></center>
<p>C is a middle-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie during the early 1970s while working at AT&T Bell Labs in the USA. The objective of its development was in the context of the re-design of the UNIX operating system to enable it to be used on multiple computers.<br>
	Earlier the language B was now used for improving the UNIX system. Being a high-level language, B allowed much faster production of code than in assembly language. Still, B suffered from drawbacks as it did not understand data-types and did not provide the use of “structures”.

	<p>1. As a middle-level language, C combines the features of both high-level and low-level languages. It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high-level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications etc.<br>
	2. C is a structured programming language which allows a complex program to be broken into simpler programs called functions. It also allows free movement of data across these functions.<br>
    3.Various features of C including direct access to machine level hardware APIs, the presence of C compilers, deterministic resource use and dynamic memory allocation make C language an optimum choice for scripting applications and drivers of embedded systems.<br>
	4.C language is case-sensitive which means lowercase and uppercase letters are treated differently.<br>
	5.C is highly portable and is used for scripting system applications which form a major part of Windows, UNIX, and Linux operating system.<br>
	6.C is a general-purpose programming language and can efficiently work on enterprise applications, games, graphics, and applications requiring calculations, etc.<br>
	7.C language has a rich library which provides a number of built-in functions. It also offers dynamic memory allocation.<br>

<center><h2><strong>Importance of function prototype in C</strong></h2></center>
<p>Function prototype tells the compiler about a number of parameters function takes data-types of parameters, and return type of function. By using this information, the compiler cross-checks function parameters and their data type with function definition and function call. If we ignore the function prototype, a program may compile with a warning and may work properly.</p>

<center><h2><strong>Functions in C</strong></h2></center>
<p>A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output.<br>
	The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function.<br>

</p>	
<p><strong>
	Why do we need functions?</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>1. Functions help us in reducing code redundancy. If functionality is performed at multiple places in software, then rather than writing the same code, again and again, we create a function and call it everywhere. This also helps in maintenance as we have to change at one place if we make future changes to the functionality.</li>
		<li>2. Functions make code modular. Consider a big file having many lines of code. It becomes really simple to read and use the code if the code is divided into functions.</li>
		<li>3. Functions provide abstraction. For example, we can use library functions without worrying about their internal working.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><strong>Function Declaration</strong>
	A function declaration tells the compiler about the number of parameters function takes, data-types of parameters, and return type of function. Putting parameter names in function declaration is optional in the function declaration, but it is necessary to put them in the definition. Below are an example of function declarations. (parameter names are not there in below declarations)
</p>
<center><img src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Function-Prototype-in-c.png" alt=""></center>
<center><h2><strong>Operators in C </strong></h2></center>
<p>Operators are the foundation of any programming language. Thus the functionality of C language is incomplete without the use of operators. Operators allow us to perform different kinds of operations on operands. In C, operators in Can be categorized in following categories: </p>
<ul>
	<li>1. Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, %, post-increment, pre-increment, post-decrement, pre-decrement)</li>
	<li>2. Relational Operators (==, !=, >, <, >= & <=) Logical Operators (&&, || and !)</li>
	<li>3. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, >> and <<)</li>
	<li>4. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, etc)</li>
	<li>5. Other Operators (conditional, comma, sizeof, address, redirection)</li>
</ul>
<center><img src="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Operators-In-C.png" alt=""></center>
<p><strong>Arithmetic Operators: </strong>hese are used to perform arithmetic/mathematical operations on operands. The binary operators falling in this category are:
	<ul>
	
	<li>Addition: The ‘+’ operator adds two operands. For example, x+y.</li>
	<li>Subtraction: The ‘-‘ operator subtracts two operands. For example, x-y.</li>
	<li>Multiplication: The ‘*’ operator multiplies two operands. For example, x*y.</li>
	<li>Division: The ‘/’ operator divides the first operand by the second. For example, x/y.</li>	
	</ul>
