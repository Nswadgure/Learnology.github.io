	<p><strong>◆Web Development◆</strong>  refers to the building, creating, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that works over the internet i.e. websites.</p>
	<center><h2><strong>◆What is Web Development?◆</strong></h2></center>
	<p>In Simplest terms, web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. By "website," we mean a collection of web pages that are publicly accessible on the internet, such as:<br>
       1)The Codecademy website<br>
       2)A closed, private network, such as your company or school intranet website.<br>
    </p>
	<p>
        Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone.
    </p>

	<p class = "p2">
		The word Web Development is made up of two words, that is:<br>
        <strong>1.Web:</strong>It refers to websites, web pages or anything that works over the internet.<br>
		<strong>2.Development:</strong>Building the application from scratch.<br>
	</p>
	<P>
		Web Development can be classified into two ways:<br>
		<strong>1)Frontend Development</strong><br>
		<strong>2)Backend Development</strong><br>
	</P>
	<p style="color: black;">
		<strong>◉Frontend Development:</strong><br>
		The part of a website that the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.
	</p>

	<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/20210309160419/frontend-design-roadmap.jpeg"></center>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>◉Backend Development:</strong><br>
		Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data.<br>
	<p>
		<strong>Backend Roadmap:</strong><br>

	</p>
	
	<center><p><strong><h2>◆1)HTML◆</h2></strong></p></center>
    <p>
		HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using the markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages and markup language defines the text document within the tag that define the structure of web pages.<br>
		<strong>➣HTML Basic Format Page Structure</strong><br>
		The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.<br>
		<strong>a.)DOCTYPE! html</strong><br>
		A doctype or document type declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in which the current page is written. It is not an element or tag. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.<br>
        <strong>b.html</strong><br>
		This tag is used to define the root element of HTML document. This tag tells the browser that it is an HTML document. It is the second outer container element that contains all other elements within it.<br>
		<strong>c.head</strong><br>
		This tag is used to define the head portion of the HTML document that contains information related to the document. Elements within the head tag are not visible on the front-end of a webpage.<br>
		<strong>d.body</strong><br>
		The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.<br>

	<center><p><strong><h2>◆2)CSS◆</h2></strong></p></center>
	<p>
		Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design the webpage to make it attractive. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.<br>
		There are three types of CSS which are given below:<br>
	    <ul>
		    <li>•Inline</li>
		    <li>•Internal or Embedded</li>
		    <li>•External</li>
	    </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>◆Why we learn CSS?◆</strong><br>
		Styling is the essential property for any website. It increases the standards and overall look of the website that makes it easier for the user to interact with it. A website can be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is mandatory.<br>
		<strong>•Base for web development:</strong> HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer should know. It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.<br>
        <strong>•Makes your website look attractive:</strong> A website that’s dull and plain will not attract the user most probably, so adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.<br>
        <strong>•Makes the design come live:</strong> A web developer is responsible for making the design given to him as a live product. It is used for styling to develop the design of the website.<br>
        <strong>•Increases user experience of the website:</strong> A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would help the users to go through the website easily. It is used to make the user interface better.<br>
        <strong>•More career opportunities:</strong> Since CSS is a basic requirement while learning Web Development, therefor there are abundant career opportunities for it. As a freelancer, you can land up to many projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>◆CSS:- Website Layout◆</strong><br>
		A website can be divided into various sections comprising of header, menus, content and footer based on which there are many different layout design available for developer. Different layouts can be created by using div tag and use CSS property to style it.<br>
		<center><img src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/website_layout-300x268.png"></center><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Header section contains a website logo, a search bar and profile of user. The navigation menu contains link to various categories of articles available and content section is divided into 3 parts(columns) with left and right sidebar containing links to other articles and advertisements whereas the main content section is the one containing this article, then at the bottom there is a footer section which contains address, links, contacts etc.<br>
        <strong>⦿Header Section:</strong> The header section is generally placed either at the top of the Website or just below a top navigation menu. It often comprises of the name of the Website or the logo of the Website.<br>
		<strong>⦿Navigation Menu:</strong> A Navigation Bar/Menu is basically a list of links that allows visitor to navigate through the website comfortably with easy access.<br>
		<strong>⦿Content Section:</strong> The content section is the main body of the website. The user can divide content section in n-column layout.<br>
		<strong>⦿Footer Section:</strong> A footer section is placed at the bottom of the webpage and it generally consists of information like contact info, copyrights, About us etc.<br.

	<center><p><strong><h2>◆Bootstrap◆</h2></strong></p></center>
	<p>
		Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap developers – Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.<br>
		<strong>◆Bootstrap:- Grid System◆</strong><br>
		Bootstrap Grid System allows up to 12 columns across the page. You can use each of them individually or merge them together for wider columns. All combinations of values summing up to 12 can be used.<br>
		➣Bootstrap grid system contains five classes which are listed below:<br>
		•<strong>.col-</strong> It is used for extra small screen devices (screen width less than 576px).<br>
		•<strong>.col-sm-</strong> It is used for small screen devices (screen width greater than or equal to 576px).<br>
        •<strong>.col-md-</strong> It is used for medium screen size devices (screen width greater than or equal to 768px).<br>
		•<strong>.col-lg-</strong> It is used for large screen size devices (screen width greater than or equal to 992px).<br>
        •<strong>.col-xl-</strong> It is used for xlarge screen size devices (screen width equal to or greater than 1200px).<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>◆Bootstrap:- Typography◆</strong><br>
		Typography is a feature of Bootstrap for styling and formatting the text content. It is used to create customized headings, inline subheadings, lists, paragraphs, aligning, adding more design-oriented font styles and much more. Bootstrap support global settings for the font stack, Headings and Link styles to be used in the web app for every type of OS and Device to deliver the best user interface.<br>
		Typography can be used to create:<br>
		•<strong>Headings</strong><br>
		•<strong>Subheadings</strong><br>
		•<strong>Text and Paragraph font color, font type and alignment</strong><br>
		•<strong>Lists</strong><br>
		•<strong>Other inline elements</strong><br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>◆How to use Bootstrap 4 on a webpage:◆</strong> There are two ways to include Bootstrap on the website.<br>
		•Include Bootstrap from the CDN link.<br>
        •Download Bootstrap from getbootstrap.com and use it.

	<center><p><strong><h2>◆3)JavaScript◆</h2></strong></p></center>
	<p>	
		JavaScript is the world most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as scripting language for web pages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.<br>
		<strong>➣</strong>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:<br>
        <strong>a)Internal JS:</strong><br>
		We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the <-script-> tag. The <-script-> tag can either be placed inside the head or the <-body-> tag according to the requirement<br>
		<strong>External JS:</strong><br>
		We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.<br>
	</p>
	<center><p><strong>◆What can we build using JavaScript?◆</strong></p></center>
    <p>       
	    <strong>➣</strong>JavaScript is a widely-used programming language. Given below are some domains/products that can be built using JavaScript:<br>
		<strong>a)Websites:</strong><br>
		JavaScript helps us to add behavior of our website. It helps users to interact with the website. For eg. clicking on buttons, saving details, uploading details on the website, etc.<br>
		<strong>b)Web Servers:</strong><br>
		We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers.<br>
		<strong>c)Game Development:</strong><br>
		In Game Development industry, JavaScript is used widely. With the addition of HTML5 Canvas, it’s now possible to make 2D and 3D games in JavaScript very efficiently.<br>
		<strong>d)3D Drawings:</strong><br>
		JavaScript in addition with HTML Canvas is used to make three-dimensional graphics.<br>
		<strong>e)Mobile Apps:</strong><br>
		Mobile applications are the most popular modes of communicating these days. JavaScript also used to design mobile applications. There are many JavaScript frameworks using which we can make android, IOS, and hybrid apps.<br>
		<strong>f)Smartwatch Apps:</strong><br>
		The popular smartwatch maker Pebble has created Pebble.js, a small JavaScript framework that allows a developer to create an application for the Pebble line of watches in JavaScript.<br>

		<center><p><strong><h2>◆TensorFlow.js◆</h2></strong></p></center>
	<p>
		TensorFlow.js is a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models on web applications and in Node.js. You can develop the machine learning models from scratch using tensorflow.js or can use the APIs provided to train your existing models in the browser or on your Node.js server.<br>
		<strong>➣Why TenserFlow.js?</strong><br>
		TensorFlow has a lot of machine learning libraries and is well-documented. It provides a few key functions and ways for doing so. TensorFlow is sometimes referred to as a “Google” product. A wide range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms are included. For handwritten digit classification, image recognition, word embedding, and the generation of other sequence models, TensorFlow can train and run deep neural networks.<br>

	<center><p><strong><h2>◆4)NodeJS◆</h2></strong></p></center>
    <p>
		Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. You need to recollect that NodeJS isn’t a framework, and it’s not a programing language. It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.<br>
		Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programing language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App. It’s utilized in production by large companies like Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart, etc.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Why to learn NodeJS?</strong><br>
		<ul>
			<li>•Easy Scalability</li>
			<li>•Real time web apps</li>
			<li>•Fast Suite</li>
			<li>•Easy to learn and code</li>
			<li>•Advantage of Caching</li>
			<li>•Data Streaming</li>
			<li>•Hosting</li>
			<li>•Corporate Support</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
    <p>
		<strong>Features of NodeJS:</strong><br>
		There are other programming languages also which we can use to build back-end services so what makes Node.js different I am going to explain.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>•It’s easy to get started and can be used for prototyping and agile development</li>
			<li>•It provides fast and highly scalable services</li>
			<li>•It uses JavaScript everywhere, so it’s easy for a JavaScript programmer to build back-end services using Node.js</li>
			<li>•Source code cleaner and consistent.</li>
			<li>•Large ecosystem for open source library.</li>
			<li>•It has Asynchronous or Non-blocking nature.</li>
		</ul>

	<center><p><strong><h2>◆AngularJS◆</h2></strong></p></center>
    <p>
        AngularJs was originally developed in 2008-2009 by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons and is now maintained by Google. AngularJS is a Javascript open-source front-end framework that is mainly used to develop single-page web applications(SPAs). It is a continuously growing and expanding framework which provides better ways for developing web applications.<br>
		It changes the static HTML to dynamic HTML. Its features like dynamic binding and dependency injection eliminate the need for code that we have to write otherwise. AngularJS is rapidly growing and because of this reason, we have different versions of AngularJs with the latest stable being 1.7.7. It is also important to note that Angular is different from AngularJs. It is an open-source project which can be freely used and changed by anyone. It extends HTML attributes with Directives, and data is bound with HTML.<br>
		<ul>
			<li>•AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that is mainly used for Frontend Development.</li>
			<li>•It is used for making Single Page Applications(SPA).</li>
			<li>•It is open source and is completely free for everyone.</li>
			<li>•It uses the Model, View, Control(MVC) pattern for developing projects.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<center><p><strong><h2>◆5)jQuery◆</h2></strong></p></center>
	<P>
		jQuery is an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript. Elaborating the terms, it simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser JavaScript development.<br>
		<strong>Why to use jQuery?</strong><br>
		Some of the key points that support the answer for why to use jQuery:<br>
		•It helps us to manipulate HTML and CSS<br>
		•It helps us to manipulate DOM (Document Object Model) elements<br>
		•Provides event methods to trigger and respond to an events on a html page such as mouse click, keypress etc.<br>
		•Implements AJAX calls.<br>
		
	</P>
	<p>
		<strong>jQuery (JavaScript library) on HTML page:</strong> There are several ways to start using it on your website.<br>
        •Use the Google-hosted/Microsoft-hosted content delivery network (CDN) to include a version.<br>
	    •Download it from official website jQuery.com and host it on your server or local filesystem.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>◆Advantages of jQuery◆</strong><br>
		•Wide range of plug-ins that allows developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library.<br>
		•Large development community.<br>
		•It is a lot easier to use compared to standard javascript and other javascript libraries.<br>
		•It lets users develop Ajax templates with ease. Ajax enables a sleeker interface where actions can be performed on pages without requiring the entire page to be reloaded.<br>
		•Being Light weight and a powerful chaining capabilities makes it more strong.<br.
	</p>
	<P>  
		<strong>◆Disadvantages of jQuery◆</strong><br>
		•While jQuery has an impressive library in terms of quantity, depending on how much customization you require on your website. The functionality may be limited thus using raw javascript may be inevitable in some cases.<br>
        •The JQuery javascript file is required to run the commands, while the size of this file is relatively small (25-100KB depending on the server). It is still a strain on the client computer and maybe your web server as well if you intend to host the script on your own web server.<br>
	</P>

	<center><p><strong><h2>◆6)ReactJS◆</h2></strong></p></center>
	<p>
        React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source, component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of the application. It is maintained by Facebook.<br>
		React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your code more predictable and easier to debug.<br>
	</p>
   <p>
	    <strong>◆Features of React.js:◆</strong><br>
		<strong>a)Use JSX:</strong> It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript. It makes it easier for us to create templates.<br>
        <strong>b)Virtual DOM:</strong> Virtual DOM exists which is like a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. So for every object that exists in the original DOM, there is an object for that in React Virtual DOM. It is exactly the same, but it does not have the power to directly change the layout of the document. Manipulating DOM is slow, but manipulating Virtual DOM is fast as nothing gets drawn on the screen.<br>
        <strong>c)One-way Data Binding:</strong> This feature gives you better control over your application.<br>
        <strong>d)Component:</strong> A Component is one of the core building blocks of React. In other words, we can say that every application you will develop in React will be made up of pieces called components. Components make the task of building UIs much easier. You can see a UI broken down into multiple individual pieces called components and work on them independently and merge them all in a parent component which will be your final UI.<br>
        <strong>e)Performance:</strong> React.js use JSX, which is faster compared to normal JavaScript and HTML. Virtual DOM is a less time taking procedure to update webpages content.<br>

	<center><p><strong><h2>PHP:- Introduction</h2></strong></p></center>
	<P>
		The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. It is open-source which means it is free to download and use. It is very simple to learn and use. The files have the extension “.php”.<br>
		Rasmus Lerdorf inspired the first version of PHP and participating in the later versions. It is an interpreted language and it does not require a compiler.<br>
		•PHP code is executed in the server.
        •It can be integrated with many databases such as Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Sybase, Informix.<br>
        •It is powerful to hold a content management system like WordPress and can be used to control user access.<br>
        •It supports main protocols like HTTP Basic, HTTP Digest, IMAP, FTP, and others.<br>
        •Websites like www.facebook.com, www.yahoo.com are also built on PHP.<br>
        •One of the main reasons behind this is that PHP can be easily embedded in HTML files and HTML codes can also be written in a PHP file.<br>
        •The thing that differentiates PHP from the client-side language like HTML is, PHP codes are executed on the server whereas HTML codes are directly rendered on the browser. PHP codes are first executed on the server and then the result is returned to the browser.<br>
        •The only information that the client or browser knows is the result returned after executing the PHP script on the server and not the actual PHP codes present in the PHP file. Also, PHP files can support other client-side scripting languages like CSS and JavaScript.
