				<center><h2><strong>Calculus Integration</strong></h2></center>
				<p>Calculus Integration is the act of bringing together smaller components into a single system that functions as one.
		The integrals enumerated here are those termed definite integrals, which can be interpreted as the signed area of the region in the plane that is bounded by the graph of a given function between two points in the real line. Conventionally, areas above the horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the given function. In this case, they are called indefinite integrals. The fundamental theorem of calculus relates definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function when its antiderivative is known.<br>
		Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from ancient Greek mathematics, the principles of integration were formulated independently by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of infinitesimal width. Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that approximates the area of a curvilinear region by breaking the region into thin vertical slabs.    </p>
			
						<center><h2><strong>An introduction to calculus integration</strong></h2></center>
			<p> The integral sign ∫ represents integration. The symbol dx, called the differential of the variable x, indicates that the variable of integration is x. The function f(x) is called the integrand, the points a and b are called the limits (or bounds) of integration, and the integral is said to be over the interval [a, b], called the interval of integration.[17] A function is said to be integrable if its integral over its domain is finite. If limits are specified, the integral is called a definite integral.
		
		Integration is the calculation of an integral. Integrals in maths are used to find many useful quantities such as areas, volumes, displacement, etc. When we speak about integrals, it is related to usually definite integrals. The indefinite integrals are used for antiderivatives. Integration is one of the two major calculus topics in Mathematics, apart from differentiation(which measure the rate of change of any function with respect to its variables).</p>
			<p>The integration denotes the summation of discrete data. The integral is calculated to find the functions which will describe the area, displacement, volume, that occurs due to a collection of small data, which cannot be measured singularly. In a broad sense, in calculus, the idea of limit is used where algebra and geometry are implemented. Limits help us in the study of the result of points on a graph such as how they get closer to each other until their distance is almost zero.
		The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the method of exhaustion of the ancient Greek astronomer Eudoxus , which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known.[1] This method was further developed and employed by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.
		
		A similar method was independently developed in China around the 3rd century AD by Liu Hui, who used it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son mathematicians Zu Chongzhi and Zu Geng to find the volume of a sphere.
		
		In the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as Alhazen (c. 965 – c. 1040 AD) derived a formula for the sum of fourth powers.[4] He used the results to carry out what would now be called an integration of this function, where the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.
		
		The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this time, the work of Cavalieri with his method of Indivisibles, and work by Fermat, began to lay the foundations of modern calculus,[6] with Cavalieri computing the integrals of xn up to degree n = 9 in Cavalieri's quadrature formula.[7] Further steps were made in the early 17th century by Barrow and Torricelli, who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and differentiation. Barrow provided the first proof of the fundamental theorem of calculus.[8] Wallis generalized Cavalieri's method, computing integrals of x to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.

				<center><h2><strong>Definition of integration in mathematics. ?</strong></h2></center>
			<P>integration, in mathematics, technique of finding a function g(x) the derivative of which, Dg(x), is equal to a given function f(x). This is indicated by the integral sign “∫,” as in ∫f(x), usually called the indefinite integral of the function.<br>
		Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalization for a certain class of "simple" functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of Daniell for the case of real-valued functions on a set X, generalized by Nicolas Bourbaki to functions with values in a locally compact topological vector space. See Hildebrandt 1953 for an axiomatic characterization of the integral.

		<center><h2><strong>Summation:</strong></h2></center>
		<p>The discrete equivalent of integration is summation. Summations and integrals can be put on the same foundations using the theory of Lebesgue integrals or time scale calculus.
		</p>
			
			<center><h2><strong>Application of integration</strong></h2></center>
			<p>
			   <strong>1.Analytical</strong><br>
			   The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the fundamental theorem of calculus. Let f(x) be the function of x to be integrated over a given interval [a, b]. Then, find an antiderivative of f; that is, a function F such that F′ = f on the interval. Provided the integrand and integral have no singularities on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,
		
		{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a).} {\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a).}
		Sometimes it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals. Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable. Techniques include integration by substitution, integration by parts, integration by trigonometric substitution, and integration by partial fractions.
		
		Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many nonelementary integrals can be expanded in a Taylor series and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be summed analytically. The method of convolution using Meijer G-functions can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, Parseval's identity can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum.
		Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example of this, see Gaussian integral.
		
		Computations of volumes of solids of revolution can usually be done with disk integration or shell integration.
		Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the list of integrals.

			   <strong>2.Symbolic</strong><br>
			  Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for the integral is desired. Extensive tables of integrals have been compiled and published over the years for this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to computer algebra systems that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such systems, like Macsyma and Maple.
			</p>
				<p><strong>3.Numerical</strong><br>
				Definite integrals may be approximated using several methods of numerical integration. The rectangle method relies on dividing the region under the function into a series of rectangles corresponding to function values and multiplies by the step width to find the sum. A better approach, the trapezoidal rule, replaces the rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The trapezoidal rule weights the first and last values by one half, then multiplies by the step width to obtain a better approximation.
				The idea behind the trapezoidal rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the integral, can be carried further: Simpson's rule approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic function.
			</p>	
			<p>
				<strong>4.Mechanica</strong><br>
				The area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called planimeter. The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid displaced as the object is submerged.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>5.Geometrical</strong><br>
				Area can sometimes be found via geometrical compass-and-straightedge constructions of an equivalent square.
