		<center><h2><strong>Digital Marketing</strong></h2></center>
		<button="lets go"><a href="https://youtu.be/lsf060bLH_Y"></a></button>
	
	<p> marketing that uses electronic devices and can be used by marketing specialists to convey promotional messaging and measure its impact through your customer journey. In practice, digital marketing typically refers to marketing campaigns that appear on a computer, phone, tablet, or other device. It can take many forms, including online video, display ads, search engine marketing, paid social ads and social media posts. Digital marketing is often compared to “traditional marketing” such as magazine ads, billboards, and direct mail. Oddly, television is usually lumped in with traditional marketing.</p>

	<center><h2><strong>What is Digital Marketing</strong></h2></center>
	<p>Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is the promotion of brands to connect with potential customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication. This includes not only email, social media, and web-based advertising, but also text and multimedia messages as a marketing channel.</p>
	
		<center><h2><strong>Inbound marketing versus digital marketing</strong></h2> </center>
	<p>Digital marketing and inbound marketing are easily confused, and for good reason. Digital marketing uses many of the same tools as inbound marketing—email and online content, to name a few. Both exist to capture the attention of prospects through the buyer’s journey and turn them into customers. But the 2 approaches take different views of the relationship between the tool and the goal.<br>
        Digital marketing considers how each individual tool can convert prospects. A brand's digital marketing strategy may use multiple platforms or focus all of its efforts on 1 platform.<br>
        Inbound marketing is a holistic concept. It considers the goal first, then looks at the available tools to determine which will effectively reach target customers, and then at which stage of the sales funnel that should happen.<br>
        The most important thing to remember about digital marketing and inbound marketing is that as a marketing professional, you don’t have to choose between the 2. In fact, they work best together. Inbound marketing provides structure and purpose for effective digital marketing to digital marketing efforts, making sure that each digital marketing channel works toward a goal.

<center><p><h2><strong>Types of digital marketing</strong></h2>
</center>
   <p> There are as many specializations within digital marketing as there are ways of interacting using digital media. Here are a few key examples.</p>
<center>    <h2><strong>Search engine optimization</strong></h2>
</center>
   <p> Search engine optimization, or SEO, is technically a marketing tool rather than a form of marketing in itself. The Balance defines it as “the art and science of making web pages attractive to search engines.”<br>
        The "art and science" part of SEO is what’s most important. SEO is a science because it requires you to research and weigh different contributing factors to achieve the highest possible ranking. Today, the most important elements to consider when optimizing a web page include:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Quality of content</li>
            <li>
                2.Level of user engagement </li>
            <li>3.Mobile-friendliness</li>
            <li>4. Number and quality of inbound links</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
	<p><strong>Social media marketing</strong>
		Social media marketing means driving traffic and brand awareness by engaging people in discussion online. The most popular platforms for social media marketing are Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, with LinkedIn and YouTube not far behind.<br>
		Because social media marketing involves active audience participation, it has become a popular way of getting attention. It's the most popular content medium for B2C marketers at 96%, and it's gaining ground in the B2B sphere as well. According to the Content Marketing Institute, 61% of B2B content marketers increased their use of social media this year.<br>

	</p>

	<p><strong>Digital Marketing Strategies: </strong>
		For digital marketers, the theoretical framework of digital marketing includes all the strategies on how to best reach this online audience. This might include email marketing, direct message marketing to reach people on their mobile devices, video streams, and social media announcements.<br>
		Some marketers are also using offline marketing methods, too, to include in their theoretical framework of digital marketing. This might include strategies around newspaper ads, product flyers, street-level marketing methods and more.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Positioning to the Customer:</strong>
		Another example of digital marketing theories includes customer-led positioning theory. This holds that the customer is the one showing the marketers what they want in the product or service. The customer can offer insights to the product team by gathering data about prices, product features, product function and more.<br>
		For example, when customers purchase medications, they are more inclined to know how the product interacts with their body, and how it can combine with other medications. These attributes in a customer-led theory of digital marketing are more important than price to medical drug purchasers.<br>
		Choosing to do digital marketing for your small business will result in a lot of work, but it holds the promise of bringing in solid rewards for your company's brand and revenue.

		<center><h2><strong>What is Push Marketing?</strong></h2></center>
		<p>Push marketing is basically the traditional form of marketing, where businesses use television, radio, direct mail, print, billboards, etc. to get their message in front of a target audience. Audience engagement originates entirely with the advertiser, so by nature it requires a very wide range of reach in order to be effective. This isn’t to say push marketing is ineffective; however, for businesses that don’t have access to a large advertising budget, push marketing should be approached with a diligent emphasis on efficiency of ad spend.</p>
		<center><h2><strong>What is Pull Marketing?</strong></h2></center>
		<p>Pull marketing bypasses the first major obstacle to sales and conversions – generating audience interest. With pull marketing, businesses simply put their product or service in the path of potential customers who are already looking for what they have to offer.<br>
			Consumers today conduct more research before buying than ever before, as they have access to online reviews, product information sites, and recommendations from friends on social media. As potential customers search for information about a desired product or service, pull marketers can capitalize on this by being in the “right place at the right time.”
