				<strong>Probability</strong></h2></center>
			
			</div>
			<p><strong>Probability</strong>Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is true. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1, where, roughly speaking, 0 indicates impossibility of the event and 1 indicates certainty.[note 1][1][2] The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.</p>
		<center><h2><strong>An introduction to Probability</strong></h2></center>
		<p> According to Richard Jeffrey, "Before the middle of the seventeenth century, the term 'probable' (Latin probabilis) meant approvable, and was applied in that sense, univocally, to opinion and to action. A probable action or opinion was one such as sensible people would undertake or hold, in the circumstances.However, in legal contexts especially, 'probable' could also apply to propositions for which there was good evidence. </p>
			<p>The sixteenth-century Italian polymath Gerolamo Cardano demonstrated the efficacy of defining odds as the ratio of favourable to unfavourable outcomes (which implies that the probability of an event is given by the ratio of favourable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes). Aside from the elementary work by Cardano, the doctrine of probabilities dates to the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal (1654).
			 Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject.Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre's Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics.See Ian Hacking's The Emergence of Probability and James Franklin's. The Science of Conjecture for histories of the early development of the very concept of mathematical probability.
			</p>
		<p>In 1906, Andrey Markov introduced the notion of Markov chains, which played an important role in stochastic processes theory and its applications. The modern theory of probability based on the measure theory was developed by Andrey Kolmogorov in 1931.</p>
		
			<center><h2><strong> What is Probability ?</strong></h2></center>
		<P>Probability is simply how likely something is to happen. Whenever we're unsure about the outcome of an event, we can talk about the probabilities of certain outcomes—how likely they are. The analysis of events governed by probability is called statistics.
		</P>

		<p style="color: black;">
			Example: Probability is the likelihood or chance of an event occurring. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and it being heads is ½, because there is 1 way of getting a head and the total number of possible outcomes is 2 (a head or tail). We write P(heads) = ½ .</p>
		<center><h2><strong>What is the meaning of probability in statistics?</strong></h2></center>
		<p>Probability is the measure of the likelihood that an event will occur in a Random Experiment. Probability is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, where, loosely speaking, 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>How to calculate probability?-</strong><br>
			Calculating probability requires following a simple formula and using multiplication and division to evaluate possible outcomes of events like launching new products, marketing to larger audiences or developing a new lead generation strategy. You can use the following steps to calculate probability, and this can work for many applications that fall under a probability format:
					1.Determine a single event with a single outcome.
					2.Identify the total number of outcomes that can occur.
					3.Divide the number of events by the number of possible outcomes.</p>
	
		<center><h2><strong>Odds vs. probability:</strong></h2></center>
		<p>Probability differs from determining the odds of something occurring. To help illustrate this concept, use the example of calculating the probability of rolling a die and getting a three on the first roll. You first determine the event you are looking for, which is rolling a three on the first try, and then you divide this number by the number of total outcomes you can get. Since the die has six faces, you can assume that you can have six total possible outcomes.
			   So the probability will be one in six or a 1/6 chance of rolling a three on the first try.
			   Determining the likelihood of this event actually occurring is referred to as "the odds." The odds, or chance, of something happening depends on the probability. Probability represents the likelihood of an event occurring for a fraction of the number of times you test the outcome. The odds take the probability of an event occurring and divide it by the probability of the event not occurring.
			   So in the case of rolling a three on the first try, the probability is 1/6 that you will roll a three, while the probability that you won't roll a three is 5/6. The odds are represented by dividing these two probabilities: 1/6 ÷ 5/6 resulting in a 1/5 (or 20%) chance that you will actually roll a three on the first try. While the two mathematical concepts can be used together to solve various problems, you will need to calculate probability before determining the odds of an event taking place.
		   </p>

			<strong>Pre-requisites to learn Probability:</strong><br>
			To understand continuous probability you will need to know basic calculus (the kind you get from a first course, and then some). Introductory courses don't usually cover multivariate Gaussians, but these require some linear algebra. Summarizing, you will need to be confident about some fairly basic topics.<br>

		<center><h2><strong>Classification of Probability:</strong></h2></center>
		<p>
			Formally, an "ordinary" classifier is some rule, or function, that assigns to a sample x a class label ŷ:
	
		 {\displaystyle {\hat {y}}=f(x)} {\hat  {y}}=f(x)
		 The samples come from some set X (e.g., the set of all documents, or the set of all images), while the class labels form a finite set Y defined prior to training.
		 Probabilistic classifiers generalize this notion of classifiers: instead of functions, they are conditional distributions {\displaystyle \Pr(Y\vert X)} \Pr(Y\vert X), meaning that for a given {\displaystyle x\in X} x\in X, they assign probabilities to all {\displaystyle y\in Y} y\in Y (and these probabilities sum to one). 
		 "Hard" classification can then be done using the optimal decision rule[2]:
		 {\displaystyle {\hat {y}}=\operatorname {\arg \max } {y}\Pr(Y=y\vert X)} {\hat  {y}}=\operatorname {\arg \max }{{y}}\Pr(Y=y\vert X)
		 or, in English, the predicted class is that which has the highest probability.
		 Binary probabilistic classifiers are also called binary regression models in statistics. In econometrics, probabilistic classification in general is called discrete choice.
		 Some classification models, such as naive Bayes, logistic regression and multilayer perceptrons (when trained under an appropriate loss function) are naturally probabilistic. Other models such as support vector machines are not, but methods exist to turn them into probabilistic classifiers.<br>
		 <strong>Generative and conditional training:</strong>
		 Some models, such as logistic regression, are conditionally trained: they optimize the conditional probability {\displaystyle \Pr(Y\vert X)} \Pr(Y\vert X) directly on a training set (see empirical risk minimization). 
		 Other classifiers, such as naive Bayes, are trained generatively: at training time, the class-conditional distribution {\displaystyle \Pr(X\vert Y)} \Pr(X\vert Y) and the class prior {\displaystyle \Pr(Y)} \Pr(Y) are found, and the conditional distribution {\displaystyle \Pr(Y\vert X)} {\displaystyle \Pr(Y\vert X)} is derived using Bayes' rule.<br>
		 <strong>Probability calibration:</strong>
		 Not all classification models are naturally probabilistic, and some that are, notably naive Bayes classifiers, decision trees and boosting methods, produce distorted class probability distributions.
		 [3] In the case of decision trees, where Pr(y|x) is the proportion of training samples with label y in the leaf where x ends up, these distortions come about because learning algorithms such as C4.5 or CART explicitly aim to produce homogeneous leaves (giving probabilities close to zero or one, and thus high bias) while using few samples to estimate the relevant proportion (high variance).    </p>
		
		<center><h2><strong>Application of Probability:</strong></h2></center>
		<p>
		   <strong>1.Weather Planning:</strong><br>
		   A probability forecast is an assessment of how likely an event can occur in terms of percentage and record the risks associated with weather. Meteorologists around the world use different instruments and tools to predict weather changes. They collect the weather forecast database from around the world to estimate the temperature changes and probable weather conditions for a particular hour, day, week, and month.<br>
		   Example:
		   if there are 40 % chances of raining then the weather condition is such that 40 out of 100 days it has rained.</p>
		
		 <p>
		   <strong>2.Sports Strategies:</strong><br>
		   In sports, analyses are conducted with the help of probability to understand the strengths and weaknesses of a particular team or player. Analysts use probability and odds to foretell outcomes regarding the team’s performance and members in the sport.
			   Coaches use probability as a tool to determine in what areas their team is strong enough and in which all areas they have to work to attain victory. Trainers even use probability to gauge the capacity of a particular player in his team and when to allow him to play and against whom.<br>
			   Example: 
			   A cricket coach evaluates a player's batting and bowling capability by taking his average performances in previous matches before placing him in the lineup.</p>
		
		<p><strong>3.Insurance:</strong><br>
			insurance companies use the theory of probability or theoretical probability for framing a policy or completing at a premium rate. The theory of probability is a statistical method used to predict the possibility of future outcomes.<br>
			Example: 
			Issuing health insurance for an alcoholic person is likely more expensive compared to the one issued to a healthy person. Statistical analysis shows high health risks for a regular alcoholic person, ensuring them is a great financial risk given a higher probability of serious illness and hence filing a claim of premium money.</p>
		<p>
		   <strong>4.In Games:</strong><br>
			  Blackjack, poker, gambling, all sports, board games, video games use probability to know how likely a team or person has chances to win.</p>
